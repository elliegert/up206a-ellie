I've most recently been working with The Trust for Public Land and other LA organizations to figure out how to make it possible/easier to convert hot asphalt schoolyards to greener park-like spaces within the Los Angeles Unified School Distirict. I also really like biking and running and hiking and doing anything outside - so that is most likely what I am doing when I'm not doing school!

# Learning Goals/Objectives

* I'm also interested in mapping something related to biking, bike routes, streets that could accomodate bike lanes, etc. in LA 
* I'm also interested in environemntal burdens throughout LA and
